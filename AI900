#   Introduction
	
AI is creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key elements include:

** Machine learning ** - This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make prediction and draw conclusions from data.
Anomaly detection - The capability to automatically detect errors or unusual activity in a system.
Computer vision - The capability of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
Natural language processing - The capability for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
Conversational AI - The capability of a software "agent" to participate in a conversation.
